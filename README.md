I created Csv_to_Invoice, a website allows shopkeepers to easily upload CSV files containing order details and view a comprehensive list of all orders on a user-friendly dashboard. The website was built using MERN stack along with npm packages like multer for file uploading,cors,and axios.This is just an basic version, lot more to develop it in the future.
